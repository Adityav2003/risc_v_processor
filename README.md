The RISC-V architecture is a modern, open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) gaining significant 
traction in academia and industry. Its modularity and openness encourage innovation and customization, 
making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance 
computing. The RISC-V ISA features a simple and elegant design, prioritizing efficiency and performance. 
It employs a load-store architecture, meaning that data access is limited to explicit load and store 
instructions, promoting a streamlined execution model. One of the key advantages of RISC-V is its 
extensibility. The architecture allows for custom instructions to be added,  tailoring the ISA to specific 
application requirements. This flexibility fosters innovation and enables developers to optimize   
performance for their particular use cases. The RISC-V instruction set is divided into various categories 
based on their functionality, encompassing basic arithmetic operations, data transfer instructions, control 
flow mechanisms, and more.
